 * \section nf_config_parser 		New Config Parser
 *
 * The new config parser in V4.1 allows you to verify your sccp.conf for use with chan-sccp-b. If you set debug = core,config in the beginning of the
 * config file and issue "sccp reload" in CLI, the sccp.conf file will be loaded and you will get output per line about it status and interpretation.
 *
 * You can also reload with a different sccp.conf file if you like, i.e. "sccp reload sccp.test.conf"
 *
 * In the contrib directory you will find gen_sccpconf.c which allows you to generate several file types (conf / sql / xml). The information is 
 * directly generated from the sccp sources and will therefor always produce a correct sample file.
 *
 *
 *
 * \section nf_emulated_enbloc		Emulated EnBloc Dialing for older devices
 *
 * Emulated Enbloc dialing has been added to make older phones react faster when dialing with the receiver down or pressing re-dial. The individual
 * buttonpresses are still send over the line in seperate tcp packets, but when we recognize that the buttonpresses arrive in a monotonous stream with 
 * equidistant timing between the buttons, we assume that the number was dialed before picking up the receive and start the call immediatly instead of 
 * waiting for more digits to arrive. This negates the secundairy digit waiting.
 *
 *
 * 
 * \section nf_protocol_handler 		New SCCP Protocol Handler / Protocol Version
 *
 * Protocol version does not have to be set anymore in sccp.conf and is extrapolated automatically when the device registers. The new protocol handler
 * always tries to use the highest possible sccp protocol version the device is capable of handling.
 *
 *
 * 
 * \section nf_rtp_handling			Rewritten RTP Handling
 *
 * RTP handling and codec dissemination has been completely rewritten in V4.1. 
 *
 *
 * 
 * \section nf_multiple_asterisk_support 	Support for multiple asterisk version in one code base
 *
 * With V4.1 multiple versions os Asterisk are supported on one code base. On the chan-sccp-b side the same code is used for any asterisk version. The 
 * pbx specific code is handled by pbx_impl which should be seen as a singular/stable API for dealing with asterisk.
