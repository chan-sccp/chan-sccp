 * \page faq Frequently Asked Questions
 * 
 * Here, you can find the answers to a few frequently asked questions.
 * For up to date Help, Faq, Bug Reporting have a look here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/chan-sccp-b/support.
 * 
 * \section a Compilation
 * Compilation related issues.
 *
 * \subsection a1 How to Compile
 * Q: How to Compile chan_sccp-b
 *
 * A: We are using the standard autoconf/automake principle. This means the only thing
 * you have to do to compile your application is run:
 * \code
 * ./configure
 * ./make
 * ./make install
 * \endcode
 * To get everything install using the default values. It will try and determine all the 
 * relevant dependecies and compile the application.
 * If you need any specific functionality, or need to specify a location of for example
 * your asterisk installatin you can use "\code./configure --help\endcode" to figure out the
 * switches you need. 
 * To Read more about using ./configure, read the INSTALL document in the root of this project 
 * directory.
 *
 * \subsection a2 Compilation Errors
 * Q: How to solve compilations errors
 *
 * A: First try to work out what ./configure is complaining about, when it is. I normally tries to
 * be as explicit as possible. If you get errors trying to start configure, first try to resolve it
 * using:
 * \code
 * ./tools/bootstrap.sh
 * \endcode
 * This till try and build a new configure application for your machine 
 * (autoconf, automake, libtool and m4 are required).
 * 
 * If nothing helps, send a message to our bug page via http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=186378&atid=917045.
 * Please include config.log when sending a bug about configure/make

 * \section b Troubleshooting
 *
 * Q. Can't dial-in or dial-out of an SCCP Phone
 *
 * A. Check the context which has been set in the sccp.conf or realtime tables. 
 *    Please make sure you have a corresponding context in your dialplan (extensions.conf / extenstions.ael). You can
 *    also change the sccp.conf context(s) to a context you already use in your dialplan (like default / from-internal-users).
 *
 * Q. No audio when calling or being called
 * 
 * A. Normally this comes down to the need for in-direct rtp traffic, because there is a firewall between your phones which
 * is performing Network Address Translations (NAT). You can check this via: http://www.amibehindnat.com.
 * Simple solution: Turn directrtp=off and nat=on in you sccp.conf or realtime tables and try again.
 *
 * Also check your settings for sccp.conf: externip and localnet
 * In rtp.conf you can make the block of used rtp ports smaller and forward this whole block of UDP ports to your asterisk box.
 *
 * Read more here: \ref NAT Troubles using VOIP and SCCP through a Firewall (NAT)
 *
 * Q. No DMTF at all
 *
 * A. Set directrtp=none in your sccp.conf or realtime tables and give it another try. You can also specify the type of
 *    DTMF used per device with dtmfmode=inband/outofband (inband can be heard, out-of-band is rfc2833 and can not be heard). 
 *    to use inband you will also need earlyrtp=progress (choose from none, offhook, dial, ringout and progress). to be able to use DTMF in IVR's for example.
 *
 * Q. No DMTF during calls
 *
 * A. Set earlyrtp=progress or ringout in your sccp.conf or realtime tables and try again, this will make it possible for inband
 *    DTMF tones to be received and heard starting at call progress
 *
 * Q. How do i report an Issue or Problem i have
 *
 * A. You can find detailed information about reporting problems/issues here: \ref Problems. Please do set you debug levels 
 *    according to the issue you have. Otherwise we have to wade through piles of uninformative messages to get to the correct
 *    location. And try to describe you issue as exact as possible.
 *
 * \section c Dialplan
 * 
 * Q: How do you dial an SCCP from your dialplan
 * 
 * A: Use a dial statement like this
 * \code
 * Dial(SCCP/998,120)
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Q: How to Dial an SCCP Phone with a different ring
 * 
 * A: Added ringer=inside to the dial statement
 * \code
 * Dial(SCCP/198/ringer=inside,120)
 * \endcode
 *
 * \code
 * ringer= values:
 *   - outside
 *   - inside
 *   - feature
 *   - silent
 *   - urgent
 *   . 
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Q: Dial a line and have the phone Auto Answer (Used for Paging for example)
 * 
 * A: add the following to your dial statement to page lines 9291 and 9292 with one way audio
 * \code
 * Dial(SCCP/9291/aa=1w&SCCP/9292/aa=1w, 120)
 * \endcode
 * 
 * aa= values:
 *   - 1w: 1way audio (MIC on other side is OFF).
 *   - 2w: 2way audio (MIC on other side is ON).
 *   - 1wb: 1way and reject cause: busy
 *   - 1wu: 1way and reject cause: unavailable
 *   - 1wc: 1way and reject cause: congestion
 *   - 2wb: 2way and reject cause: busy
 *   - 2wu: 2way and reject cause: unavailable
 *   - 2wc: 2way and reject cause: congestion
 *   .
 * 
 * 
 * Q: Get infomation about the SCCP device or line from the dialplan.
 * 
 * A: use the SCCPDEVICE, SCCPLINE and SCCPCHANNEL functions.
 * 
 * example:
 * \code
 * Set(my_ip=${SCCPDEVICE(current,ip)});
 * \endcode
 *
 * to set the variable my_ip to the ip-address of the current device. 
 * 
 * example:
 * \code
 * Set(some_ip=${SCCPDEVICE(SEP001B54CA6543,cidname)});
 * \endcode
 * 
 * to set the variable some_ip to the cidname of the device with Mac-Address 00:1B:54:CA:65:43. 
 * 
 * see \ref nf_sccp_function How to use dialplan functions
 *
 * \subsection nf_hints How to to use Hints
 * Q: How to use Hints
 *
 * A: To use a hinted speeddial you will also need an hint entry in your dialplan, which could look like:
 * 
 * extension.conf:
 * \code
 * [hints]
 *	exten => 101,hint,SCCP/101
 *	exten => 102,hint,SCCP/102
 *	exten => 103,hint,SCCP/103
 *	exten => 104,hint,SCCP/104
 *	exten => 105,hint,SCCP/105
 *      exten => 200,hint,SCCP/101&SCCP/102		// Secretaties
 * \endcode
 *
 * or
 *
 * extension.ael (in AEL2 format):
 * \code
 * context hints {
 *      hint(SCCP/101) _101 => NoOp(hint);
 *      hint(SCCP/102) _102 => NoOp(hint);
 *      hint(SCCP/103) _103 => NoOp(hint);
 *      hint(SCCP/104) _104 => NoOp(hint);
 *      hint(SCCP/105) _105 => NoOp(hint);
 *      hint(SCCP/101&SCCP/102) _200 => NoOp(hint);
 * };
 * \endcode
 *
 * Once these hints have been configured you can use them in a speedial entry in your sccp.conf like:
 *
 * \code
 * button = speeddial, "Secretaries", 200, 200@hints
 * \endcode **/
