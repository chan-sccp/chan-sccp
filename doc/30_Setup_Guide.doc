 * \section sccp_config_howto How to use the config file
 *
 * Please check out ./conf/sccp.conf for all possible sccp configuration parameters. This new config file uses standard 
 * asterisk templating to keep your config file shorter and easier to manager. For an untemplated version check-out 
 * ./conf/sccp_simple.conf
 *
 * \subsection sccp_config_howto2 Sample config files
 * 
 * Make sure you pay attention to the CONTEXT used in the config file, it must match your dialplan. We have currently specified "sccp" as the default context, you will either
 * have to add the sccp context to your dialplan in the correct locations or change the default sccp  context to something that matches your dialplan. 
 *
 * Also check the deny/permit entries to make sure they cover your network/devices and check if the bindaddr is actually 
 * reachable from the addresses you have permitted to connect.
 *
 * When using hinted speeddials it is important to provide the necessary hints in your dialplan by simply adding something 
 * like "exten => 98021,hint,SCCP/98021" in the 'default' context (or possibly "from-internal" for FreePBX users). You will have to use the same context when definining the speeddial button below. 
 * You can also create these hints in a seperate context called hints for example
 *
 * \code
 * [hints]
 * exten => 98021,hint,SCCP/98021
 * \endcode
 * 
 * That way you can refer to them in a button definition like (notice the context used to create hints in the dialplan, must match the context specified in the button definition)
 * \code
 * button = speeddial,Phone 2 Line 1, 98021, 98021@hints
 * \endcode
 *
 * Monitoring non-SCCP devices is possible by reviewing the hint status in the Asterisk CLI using the "core show hints" command.  Anything that generates a hint can be monitored using the buttons.  The following states are recognized: .... Custom state processing (see Asterisk documentation for more information) is also possible using this methodology.
 *
 * (For more information about hints check \ref nf_hints here)
 *
 * Sample Config File (Always use one from the conf direct as a starting point, or you can generate a config file with contrib/gen_sccpconf/gen_sccpconf)
 *
 * \verbinclude conf/sccp.conf
 *
 * For more config samples look in the conf directory in the root of the project. Here you will find sccp.conf, sccp_simple.conf and
 * sccp_short.conf
 *
 * \section sccp_config_load_module_howto How to load the Chan_SCCP
 *
 * The chan_sccp module can be loaded using the following lines in asterisk module.conf:
 * \code
 * noload => chan_skinny.so
 * load => chan_sccp.so
 * \endcode
 *
 * the skinny module is not allowed to be loaded, is it conflicts with chan_sccp.
 * 
 * A valid sccp.conf configfile has to be available in the asterisk configuration directory.
 *
 * \section sccp_config_rt How to use RealTime Database

 * \code
 * postgresql asterisk < conf/postgresql.sql
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection sccp_config_rt_sccp Chan_SCCP Configuration for Realtime
 *
 * Add the following lines to the sccp.conf file
 * \code
 * devicetable=sccpdevice	                          ; datebasetable for devices
 * linetable=sccpline                                     ; datebasetable for lines

 * for mysql v4:
 * \code
 * [settings]
 * sccpdevice => mysql,asterisk,sccpdevices
 * sccpline => mysql,asterisk,sccplines
 * \endcode
 *
 * for mysql v5:
 * \code
 * [settings]
 * sccpdevice => mysql,asterisk,sccpdeviceconfig	  ; make use of the sccpdeviceconfig view instead of sccpdevice
 * sccpline => mysql,asterisk,sccpline
 * \endcode
 *
 * or for postgresql:
 * \code
 * [settings]
 * sccpdevice => pgsql,asterisk,sccpdeviceconfig
 * sccpline => pgsql,asterisk,sccplines
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection sccp_config_rt_db Loading information into the tables
 *
 * Connect to the dabase
 * 
 * \code
 * insert into sccpdevices (type,description,tzoffset,dtmfmode,mwilamp,mwioncall,pickupexten,pickupmodeanswer,privacy,name) values ("7975","My 1st Phone",0,"outofband","on","on","on","on","full","SEP010102030404");
 * insert into sccplines (id,pin,label,description,context,incominglimit,transfer,mailbox,vmnum,cid_name,cid_num,trnsfvm,secondary_dialtone_digits,secondary_dialtone_tone,musicclass,language,accountcode,audio_tos,audio_cos,video_tos,video_cos,echocancel,silencesuppression,callgroup,pickupgroup,amaflags,setvar,name) VALUES(121,212,"Line 121","Line 121",internal,2,on,121,88121,"My Name",121,89121,10,"0x22","default","en",121,"0xB8",6,"0x88",5,"on","off","1,3-5","3-5","","",121);

 * insert into buttonconfig (device,instance,type,name,options) VALUES("SEP010102030404",4,"feature","cfwdbusy","122");
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection sccp_config_rt_use Using Realtime Database 
 *
 * Devices / Lines and Buttonconfigs are now loaded from the database. If you add a device to the sccpdevice table it will
 * automatically be read during the device registration fase. No need to unload/load the chan_sccp module.
 * 
 * When you change any information in the database for a specific device which you want to reset to update it's status. 
 * You can use the standard asterisk realtime function to reload information
 *
 * \code
 * realtime load sccpdevice name SEP010102030404 
 * or
 * realtime load sccpline name 123
 *
 * sccp reset SEP010102030404
 * or
 * sccp restart SEP010102030404
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \section sccp_config_dhcp Setting up a DHCP Server
 *
 * dhcpd.conf:
 *
 * \code
 * option cisco-tftp code 150 = array of ip-address;
 * 
 * subnet 192.168.100.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
 *         range 192.168.100.128 192.168.100.200;
 *         default-lease-time 86400;
 *         max-lease-time 172800;
 *         option domain-name-servers 192.168.100.2;
 *         option routers 192.168.100.1;
 * }
 * 
 * host phone1 {
 *         hardware ethernet 00:0c:ce:3a:88:ca;
 *         fixed-address 192.168.100.100;
 *         option cisco-tftp 192.168.100.2;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \section sccp_config_sep What does a Sample SEP[MacAddr].cnf.xml Look Like
 *
 * We have added a couple of example files in the directory conf/tftp  
 * conf/tftp/XMLDefault.cnf.xml_797x
 * conf/tftp/XMLDefault.cnf.xml_796x
 * conf/tftp/XMLDefault.cnf.xml_791x
 * 
 * You can choose one of these files and adapt it to your network/devices. You can then copy the file to your tftp-server and rename the file to XMLDefault.cnf.xml. 
 * If you like you can make soft links/shortcuts to this file for every device you have in the form of SEP[macaddr].cnf.xml files. For devices with specific settings
 * you can copy your XMLDefault.cnf.xml file to a new SEP[macaddr].cnf.xml file and set the specific settings for this device.

 * \section DUNDi Asterisk Clustering and DUNDi Lookup
 * DUNDi is a peer-to-peer system for locating Internet Gateways to telephony services. 
 * Unlike traditional centralized services (such as the remarkably simple and concise ENUM standard), 
 * DUNDi is fully distributed with no centralized authority whatsoever.
 * 
 * \subsection dundi_dyn DUNDI Dynamic Awareness 	(original author: J.R.Richardson)
 * 
 * If regcontext is specified in sccp.conf chan-sccp-b will dynamically create and destroy a NoOp priority 1
 * extension for a given peer/line which registers with the server. If the context is not specified in
 * extension.conf, then it will be dynamically created when an chan-sccp-b agent registers.
 * 
 * Example sccp.conf:
 * \code
 * [general]
 * regcontext=sccpregistration
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Once the phones, in this example 98011 and 98012 register with your asterisk server1, a context
 * of [sccpregistration] appears and the "show dialplan" command at the asterisk CLI> will produce:
 * 
 * \code
 * server1*CLI> dialplan show sccpregistration
 * [ Context 'sccpregistration' created by 'SCCP' ]
 *   '98011' =>        1. Noop(98011)                                [SCCP]
 *   '98011@1' =>      1. Noop(98099)                                [SCCP]
 * -= 2 extensions (2 priorities) in 1 context. =-
 * \endcode
 * 
 * This gives this PBX a dedicated context that we can map DUNDi lookup requests to. When
 * a DUNDi lookup requests location information for extension 98011, this PBX will reply
 * "yes, the extension is active here and this is the contact address". 
 * 
 * We do not have to insert a [sccpregistration] in the extensions.conf because it will
 * be created automatically as soon as the first line/extension registration occurs.
 * 
 *  * \subsection dundi_dyn DUNDI Configuration
 * 
 * In this example we will use IAX2 to make DUNDi Switch connections. There are a lot of 
 * ways to set this up, so please check the DUNDi documentation. We use a simple context in iax.conf
 * which is common for all PBX servers, like this:
 * 
 * iax.conf:
 * \code
 * [priv]
 * type=friend
 * dbsecret=dundi/secret
 * context=incomingdundi
 * \endcode
 * 
 * In the DUNDi [mappings] section, we specify what [context] in extensions.conf we want
 * to allow DUNDi request access to. This is how the cluster sees any available SCCP 
 * Agents in the [sccpregistration] context on this PBX.
 * 
 * \code
 * dundi.conf
 * [mappings]
 * priv => sccpregistration,0,IAX2,priv:${SECRET}@10.10.10.10.1/${NUMBER},nopartial]
 * \endcode
 *

 * \section NAT Troubles using VOIP and SCCP through a Firewall (NAT)
 * 
 * What is this NAT and why does this cause problems with VOIP, RTP and sound ?
 *
 * In addition, the way in which conventional VoIP protocols are designed is also posing a problem to VoIP traffic passing 
 * through NAT. Conventional VoIP protocols only deal with the signalling of a telephone connection. The audio traffic is 
 * handled by another protocol and to make matters worse, the port on which the audio traffic is sent is random. 
 * The NAT router may be able to handle the signalling traffic, but it has no way of knowing that the audio traffic is 
 * related to the signalling and should hence be passed to the same device the signalling traffic is passed to. 
 * As a result, the audio traffic is not translated properly between the address spaces. 
 * 
 * At first, for both the calling and the called party everything will appear just fine. The called party will see the 
 * calling party's Caller ID and the telephone will ring while the calling party will hear a ringing feedback tone at the 
 * other end. When the called party picks up the telephone, both the ringing and the associated ringing feedback tone at 
 * the other end will stop as one would expect. However, the calling party will not hear the called party (one way audio) 
 * and the called party may not hear the calling party either (no audio). 
 * 
 * The issue of NAT Traversal is a major problem for the widespread deployment of VOIP. Yet, the issue is non-trivial and 
 * there are no simple solutions. In general terms there are two ways to deal with this problem: 
 * - Don't use NAT, i.e. public ip-addresses for a your phone (not a solution)
 * - Build a tunnel between the networks that need to communicate with each other, No NAT Required over the tunnel.
 * - Put Asterisk on the Firewall and make it the go-between / proxy. See next point. (For SCCP: set directrtp=off in your config).
 * - Use a Firewall Connection Tracking Plugin which records outgoing VOIP Connections and Maps there return RTP connections. 
 *   For example for iptables this plugin is called: nf_nat_sip.ko or nf_nat_h323.ko. At this moment in time we do not have a 
 *   version for sccp, yet. (But for SIP and H323 it works very well).
 * .
 * Other works arounds:
 * - Use static ip-address on your phones and creates forwards in your firewall for the SCCP port and a block of RTP ports for this phone.
 * - Put a SIP-Proxy on the Firewall and reroute the packets. You could use for example : SER (Sip Express Router), SIPProxd or RTPProxy.
 * - Use a STUN Server: http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/STUN, http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sipping-nat-scenarios-13 
 * - Find and IAX2 provider instead of SIP. IAX can encapsulate RTP with its packets and therefor traverse NAT without any
 *   problems. 
 * .

 * 
 * \section shared_lines Shared Lines
 *  
 * Shared lines are lines used by several devices at the same time providing easy handling of phone calls between them. You can
 * for example hold a line on one device and use resume on another to pick the line up there. Or even steal a line from another
 * device using the Intercept button.
 *
 * To set up a shared line, you just define the same extension/line number on multiple devices. You can add a suffix or subscriptionId to the extension
 * number to be able to call a specific device using "@" and if you like an extra callerid_name behind ":", like this:
 *
 * \code
 * [SEP00000001]
 * ...
 * button = line, 900@1:Kitchen
 * ...
 *
 * [SEP00000002]
 * ...
 * button = line, 900@2:LivingRoom!silent
 * ...
 * \endcode 
 *
 * If you now create the relevant entries in your dialplan you can either call 900, 9001, 9002 using this example:
 *
 * \code
 * _9XX =>{
 *        Dial(SCCP/${EXTEN});
 * };
 *
 * _90XX =>{
 *      Set(extension=${EXTEN:0:3});
 *      Set(suffix=${EXTEN:3:1});
 *      Dial(SCCP/${extension}@${suffix});
 * };
 * \endcode
 *
 * To add a default suffix to a line (so all device using that line, will also be accessible via the default suffix) you
 * can add "defaultSubscriptionId_number = " to the line definition in sccp.conf.
 *
 * When "silent" is added to the subscriptionId this line will not ring if the shared line is called, this can be used when a secretary is supposed to
 * handle all incoming calls on a shared line. Only when the extension including the suffix/subscriptionId is called will this line ring.
 *
