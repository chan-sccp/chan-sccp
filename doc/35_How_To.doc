 * \section nf_shared_lines Shared Lines
 * 
 * Shared lines is simple, and is activated readily by registering multiple phones on the same line.
 * That's all, no extra options required. What happens is that all phones on a shared line "see" the calls of  
 * the other phones and vice versa. If you have a call on a shared line, just press "hold" on one phone
 * and resume that call with "resume" on another phone.
 * 
 * Earlier, without shared lines, registering multiple phones on the same line lead to an error
 * that the line was already in use. Now, you simply get a shared line.
 * <HR> 
 * 
 *
 * 
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * \section nf_phone_buttons Phone Buttons
 * 
 * We do not use the different autologin, speeddial options any longer, instead trunk uses a unified scheme for adding buttons:
 * Each button is added to the phone in the order as specified in the config file by specifying a "button" assignment. The syntax is
 * button = <empty|line|speeddial|feature|service>[, name[, option1[, option2]]]
 * 
 * buttons come in the following flavours:
 *   - empty: Empty button (no options)
 *   - line: Registers the line with identifier specified as [name]
 *   - speeddial: Adds a speeddial with label [name] and [option1] as number
       Optionally, [option2] can be used to specify a hint by extension\@context as usual.
 *   - service: Adds a service url 
 *   - Feature buttons have an on/off status represented on the device with a tick-box and can be used to set the device in a particular state. 
 *     Currently Possible [option1],[option2] combinations:
 *      - privacy,callpresent		= Make a private call, number is suppressed
 *      - privacy,hint			= Make a private call, hint is suppressed
 *      - cfwdall,number		= Forward all calls
 *      - cfwbusy,number		= Forward on busy
 *      - cfwnoaswer,number		= Forward on no-answer (not implemented yet)
 *      - DND,busy			= Do-not-disturb, return Busy signal to Caller
 *      - DND,silent			= Do-not-disturb, return nothing to caller
 *      - monitor			= Record Calls using AutoMon (asterisk 1.6.x only)
 *      - devstate,custom_devstate	= Device State Feature Button (asterisk 1.6.1 and up). 
					  custom_devstate is the name of the custom devicestate to be toggled (\ref nf_devicestate)
 *      - hold				= To be implemented
 *      - transfer			= To be implemented
 *      - multiblink			= To be implemented
 *      - mobility			= To be implemented
 *      - conference			= To be implemented
 *      .
 *   .
 * 
 * In a configuration file this could look like:
 * \code
 * button = line, 519
 * button = line, 520@01: Phone1
 * button = line, 521@02: Phone1!silent
 * button = line, 522@03: Phone1, default
 * button = empty
 * button = speeddial, "Cantine", 332, 332@hints
 * button = service, "Asterisk", "www.asterisk.org"
 * button = feature, "privacy callpresent", privacy, callpresent
 * button = feature, "callforward busy", cfwdbusy, 529
 * button = feature, "DND busy", "DND", "busy"
 * button = feature, "Record Calls", monitor
 * \endcode
 *
 * <HR>

 *
 * \section nf_dynamic_speeddial How to use Dynamic SpeedDials (now on by default)
 * 
 * Dynamic SpeedDials give additional information about the status of the lines assigned the speeddial. The
 * Icon displayed changes to indicate "IDLE", "DND", "IN USE" and "RINGING". In the latest version this feature is 
 * 
 * To use Normal SpeedDials(olod behaviour) instead of Dynamic SpeedDials you need to use a configure parameters during compilation
 * \code
 * ./configure --disable-speeddial
 * \endcode
 *
 * --disable-dynamic-speeddial = Do not use any dynamic speeddial
 * --disable-dynamic-speeddial-cid = Do not display the calledid information on the dynamic speeddial
 *
 * Dynamic SpeedDial is now switched on by default !!.
 * <HR> 
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * \section nf_hotline How to use the hotline option
 *
 * Setting the hotline Feature on a device, will make it connect to a predefined extension as soon as the Receiver
 * is picked up or the "New Call" Button is pressed. No number has to be given. This works even on devices which 
 * have no entry in the config file or realtime database. 
 *
 * The hotline function can be used in different circumstances, for example at a door, where you want people to be 
 * able to only call one number, or for unprovisioned phones to only be able to call the helpdesk to get their phone
 * set up. If hotline_enabled = yes, any device which is not included in the configuration explicitly will be allowed 
 * to registered as a guest device. All such devices will register on a single shared line called "hotline".
 * 
 * For example:
 * \code
 *   - hotline_enabled=yes
 *   - hotline_context=default
 *   - hotline_extension=111
 * \endcode
 * This will add a Hotline on all phones, dialing 111 via context default.
 * <HR>
 *
 *
 *
 * 
 *
 *
 * \section nf_adhoc_plar How to use the adhoc option (PLAR)
 *
 * Adhoc Number or Private-line automatic ringdown (PLAR): 
 * Adhoc/PLAR circuits have statically configured endpoints and do not require the user dialing to connect calls. 
 * 
 * - The adhocNumber is dialed as soon as the Phone is taken off-hook or when the new-call button is pressed 
 * - The adhocNumber will <b>not</b> be dialed when choosing a line; so when you choose a line you can enter a number manually.
 *
 * For example adding this to the line configuration:
 * \code
 *   adhocNumber = 818
 * \endcode
 * Will automatically dial 818 as soon as the Receiver is picked up or the new call button is pressed.
 * <HR>

 * Usage: SCCPSetCodec(codec)
 * Sets the preferred codec for dialing out with the next DIAL statemnet using an sccp channel.
 *
 * SCCPSetCodec(codec) is now deprecated in favour of generic channel method 'Set(CHANNEL(codec)=alaw)'. Please do not use SCCPSetCodec anymore.
 *
 * \subsection nf_sccp_dialplan_sccpsetcalledparty SCCPSetCalledParty
 * Usage: SCCPSetCalledParty("name" \<ext\>)
 * Sets the name and number of the called party before using the DIAL statement, only usefull when dialing an SCCP Channel.

 *
 *
 *
 * \section nf_devicestate         How to use devicestate
 *
 * When chan-sccp-b is used with asterisk 1.6.1 and up, you have the option to use configure directive --enable-devstate-feature.
 * This will make chan-sccp-b report back the device_state back to asterisk, to be used by for example the 
 * Dialplan DEVICE_STATE function as such:
 *
 * exten => s,1,NoOp(My phone state is currently ${DEVICE_STATE(SCCP/98011)})
 * 
 * \subsection nf_customdevicestate	Custom Device State
 *
 * If you add a new devstate button to you sccp.conf like so, you will have a new custom device state which can be set and monitored
 * \code
 * button = feature, Coffee is Ready, devstate, coffee
 * \endcode
 *
 * When you press this button the device state will go from NOT_INUSE to INUSE and back again
 *
 * You can then switch the feature devstate button on and of from the dialplan with
 * \code
 * exten => s,1,Set(DEVICE_STATE(Custom:coffee)=INUSE)
 * \endcode
 * To signal everyone that the coffee is ready.
 *
 * From the console(CLI) this can be handled via:
 * \code
 * devstate change Custom:coffee INUSE
 * \endcode
 * 
 * The new phones models with lighted buttons will nicely light up their buttons upon "INUSE".
 * 
 * You can read more about customer device states <a href="http://www.asterisk.org/node/48325">here</a>.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * \section nf_digittimeout	      Digit timeout and dialing
 * 
 * Dialing changes:
 *
 * - When entering the number with the receiver down, and then pressing dial or picking up, we calculate the standard 
 *   deviatoin between the timing of the entered numbers. If the all fall withing the same pattern (about 100 milliseconds 
 *   per digit) with a std-dev les then 3.5 we can assume the numbers are not entered by hand and emulate enbloc dialing
 *   and reduce the total digittimeout to 2000 milliseconds (2 secs after the last digit). The following two rules still apply.
 * - Matching of number uses regcontext group specified in sccp.conf first, if a full match is found, the digittimout is halved.
 * - If a full match is found in the dialplan, and no other dialplan entries would match, dialing starts immediatly.
 *
 *
