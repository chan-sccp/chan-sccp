;------------------------------ JITTER BUFFER CONFIGURATION --------------------------
;jbenable = yes						; Enables the use of a jitterbuffer on the receiving side of a
							; sccp channel. Defaults to "no". An enabled jitterbuffer will
							; be used only if the sending side can create and the receiving
							; side can not accept jitter. The sccp channel can accept
							; jitter, thus a jitterbuffer on the receive sccp side will be
							; used only if it is forced and enabled.

;jbforce = no						; Forces the use of a jitterbuffer on the receive side of a sccp
							; channel. Defaults to "no".

;jbmaxsize = 200					; Max length of the jitterbuffer in milliseconds.

;jbresyncthreshold = 1000				; Jump in the frame timestamps over which the jitterbuffer is
							; resynchronized. Useful to improve the quality of the voice, with
							; big jumps in/broken timestamps, usually sent from exotic devices
							; and programs. Defaults to 1000.

;jbimpl = fixed						; Jitterbuffer implementation, used on the receiving side of a
							; sccp channel. Two implementations are currently available
							; - "fixed" (with size always equals to jbmaxsize)
							; - "adaptive" (with variable size, actually the new jb of IAX2).
							; Defaults to fixed.

;jblog = no						; Enables jitterbuffer frame logging. Defaults to "no".

;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hotline_enabled=yes					; Setting the hotline Feature on a device, will make it connect to a predefined extension as soon as the Receiver
							; is picked up or the "New Call" Button is pressed. No number has to be given. This works even on devices which 
							; have no entry in the config file or realtime database. 
							; The hotline function can be used in different circumstances, for example at a door, where you want people to be 
							; able to only call one number, or for unprovisioned phones to only be able to call the helpdesk to get their phone
							; set up. If hotline_enabled = yes, any device which is not included in the configuration explicitly will be allowed 
							; to registered as a guest device. All such devices will register on a single shared line called "hotline".
