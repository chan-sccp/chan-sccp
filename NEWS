Version: v4.3.0_DEV
=====================
WIP
 - Reworked configure/make system:
   - Create Makefile.am per subdirectory
   - Handle each subdir as a sub-library
   - Combine the sub-libraries into the final resulting:
     chan_sccp.so during the final linking step
   - Use simple path for file inclusion
   - Clear sepearions between modules (There are still a couple of
     asterisk in the libsccp module, which should be cleaned up)
   - Reduced re-compilation when little has changed
   - Speed up during compilation
   - Slightly reduced size of the resulting binary
   - Future Potential to run for example the libsccp module
     standalone (if the current dependencies can be cleaned up)
   - Since Automake 1.4 we got warnings because of crossing
     directory boundaries during automake. This is fixed by splitting
     the makefiles
   - The sub-library Makefile.am file are simple and easy to
     maintain. The focus only on theor own directory
 - CallFlow: 
   - Revised handling shared line during incoming call
   - Revised sccp_socket / session handling during read of potentially unknown messages
   - Revised callinfo functionalty
   - Atomic Functions using trylock/spinlock instead of lock, to prevent deadlock
 - Static Analysis
   - subsequent fixes
     - nullpointer checks
     - dead code removal 
     - More boundschecking
   - deny use of strcat, sprintf, atoi and other unsafe functions
 - Add Visual Parkinglot Feature Button support
 - Improved/Fixed Cisco/69xx support
 Fixes:
  - Channel remaining after hangup
  - Timeout / Hangup Scheduler issues 
  - Session Cancellation
  - Pickup/GPickup and entries in phonebook
  - Fixed direcrtp (more work needed)
  - letohl / bswap fix
